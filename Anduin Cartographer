This dwarf if like no other you have ever seen! He hair is long, red, and
glorious. She wears tight armor leaving little to the imagination. 


Room
======
Kathra's Maps
   The room is probably well organized and full of maps and the like but you
cannot concentrate on anything but the glorious beauty of the shop owner
standing in the corner reading something you couldn't care less about.

Okay so what do you think about the following interaction after enter the room

>say reveal
or
>say reveal yourself

> Kathra seductivly touches you on the cheek, your heart races!

> But quickly the reason for your rapid palpitations changes from lust to terror

> Kathra changes form into magnificent beast!

> She springs at you with such force you both burst through the floor to the
  a lower level you didn't know existed. Ouch! That hurt! (120) <Some dmg I dunno how much 120 is just a suggestion :D>

She then starts to attack. I would say she is pretty high level and has a bunch of gold
gathered from her cartographing

Or none of that cause why would a cartographer be a honey pot I dunno could just slap and deal an insane amount of dmg cause it would be hilarious.
