Room
====
The Cartographer's Room
   This cozy little room on the main floor of the inn belongs to a skilled
cartographer. It has been meticulously filled from top to bottom side to side,
on every wall with books and scrolls. The room is smell and full but organized.

Location
=========
North of 3052. I was thinking this cartographer could be staying at the iin during his travels
and not have a "permanent" residence in Meilekki.

Features
========
Randomly emotes (or on enter)
"The Cartographer mutters something about his memory fading."
