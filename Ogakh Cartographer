Description -
This tall slender orc is obviously not in the mood to deal with the churlish.
You'd better take care. He is wearing armor that nearly resembles the orc
patroller's in town. Something has terrible must have happened to banish his
shop so far from town... Or is it here after his banishment?


Room
=====
Cartographer's Shop
   It is not clear what the room was before the outcast made it his shop but
clearly it wasn't a room that held anything with value. It is not raining,
though if it were the slatted roof would sure not keep it out this is clear
from slew of water damaged maps leaning against the wall behind the desk.

On entry
The cartographer shouts, 'Quickly now, tell me what you want and get out!'

Every few seconds like the one in Mielikki
The cartographer says, 'I don't have all day!'

Location
=========
East of the room named Outskirts on the south end of town.
